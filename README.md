This repo consist of week 1 progress of Zolvit Bootcamp

# Week 1 Summary Report

### Day 1 - Introduction to testing in Node.js

- Learnt basic concepts of testing, including its types (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Explored **Mocha** and **Chai**, and implemented basic tests.
- Applied these concepts by testing arithmetic logic in `sample.test.js`.

    ðŸ”— [View PR](https://github.com/PoshikaM/Zolvit-QE-Bootcamp/pull/1/)

### Day 2 - Unit testing with mocha and chai

- Implemented unit testing using Mocha and Chai.
- Explored **nyc** for code coverage and successfully generated reports.
- Applied testing to a basic GET request in `utils.test.js`.

### Day 3 - Integration testing with superset

- Used **Supertest** to test API endpoints.
- Implemented CRUD operation tests in api.test.js.

### Day 4 - Testing with In-Memory MongoDB

- Learned about **MongoDB In-Memory Database** for isolated testing.
- Created a clean test environment without affecting the original database.
- Tested database operations along with endpoints.

### Day 5 - Test Coverage and Reporting

- Explored tools for test coverage.
- Used **Jestâ€™s built-in support** to generate coverage reports similar to nyc.
